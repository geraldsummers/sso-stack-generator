package org.webservices.pipeline.core

/**
 * Interface for pipeline output destinations that persist or publish processed data.
 *
 * Sinks are the final stage of the pipeline, responsible for writing data to external systems:
 * - PostgreSQL (document_staging table) - Staging area with status tracking (PENDING/COMPLETED/FAILED)
 * - Qdrant (gRPC:6334) - Vector database for semantic search
 * - BookStack API (HTTP) - Knowledge base publishing
 *
 * Integration points:
 * - PostgreSQL: DocumentStagingSink writes with embedding_status=PENDING for async processing
 * - Qdrant: QdrantSink stores 1024-dimensional vectors in collection-specific indexes
 * - BookStack: BookStackSink creates pages organized by book/chapter hierarchy
 * - EmbeddingScheduler: Polls PostgreSQL for PENDING documents and updates status to COMPLETED
 * - Search-Service: Queries Qdrant and PostgreSQL for hybrid search results
 *
 * Design rationale:
 * - Batch writes improve throughput for high-volume ingestion (e.g., 100k+ Wikipedia articles)
 * - Health checks enable circuit breaker patterns when external services are unavailable
 * - Suspend functions allow non-blocking I/O for database and HTTP operations
