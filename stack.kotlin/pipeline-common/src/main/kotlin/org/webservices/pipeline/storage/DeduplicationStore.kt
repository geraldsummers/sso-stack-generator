/**
 * In-memory LRU cache with disk persistence for content deduplication across pipeline runs.
 *
 * **Why Deduplication Matters:**
 * Data sources frequently re-fetch the same content (e.g., RSS feeds include recent articles
 * on every poll, Wikipedia dumps may overlap between versions). Without deduplication:
 * - Embedding service would waste resources generating duplicate vectors
 * - Qdrant would store redundant data (increasing storage and search latency)
 * - Search results would contain duplicate entries (poor user experience)
 * - BookStack would have duplicate pages (confusing knowledge base)
 *
 * **Design Decisions:**
 * - LRU eviction: Keeps recently-seen content in memory while aging out old entries
 *   (avoids unbounded memory growth over months of operation)
 * - Disk persistence: Survives pipeline restarts without re-processing millions of docs
 *   (flush() called periodically by data sources to checkpoint state)
 * - Content-based IDs: Documents are hashed (typically SHA-256) before checking
 *   (enables byte-for-byte deduplication even when metadata differs)
 * - Thread-safe: Synchronized access allows concurrent ingestion from multiple sources
 *
 * **Integration with Pipeline:**
 * Data sources call checkAndMark() before staging documents. Only unseen documents
 * proceed to DocumentStagingStore.stageBatch(), dramatically reducing downstream load.
 *
 * Example: Ingesting 10,000 RSS articles might only yield 50 new documents after
 * deduplication, saving 9,950 embedding API calls and vector storage operations.
 *
 * @property storePath Filesystem path for persistent storage (survives container restarts)
 * @property maxEntries Maximum cache size before LRU eviction (default 10M for ~500MB RAM)
