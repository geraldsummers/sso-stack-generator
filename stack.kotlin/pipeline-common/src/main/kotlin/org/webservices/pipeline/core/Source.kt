/**
 * Base interface for data ingestion sources in the webservices pipeline.
 *
 * Sources are the entry point of the pipeline's data flow. They fetch data from external systems
 * (RSS feeds, CVE databases, Wikipedia, etc.) and emit it as a flow for downstream processing.
 *
 * Integration points:
 * - Pipeline: Sources are composed with Processors and Sinks to form complete data flows
 * - StandardizedRunner: Wraps StandardizedSource implementations for scheduled execution
 * - DeduplicationStore: Source data is checked for duplicates before processing
 *
 * Design rationale:
 * - Flow-based API enables backpressure handling and memory-efficient streaming
 * - Suspend function allows sources to perform async I/O without blocking threads
 * - Generic type T allows sources to emit domain-specific data models
