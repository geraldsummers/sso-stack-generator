/**
 * Splits long text documents into overlapping chunks that fit within BGE-M3 embedding model's token limit.
 *
 * ## Purpose
 * The BGE-M3 embedding model has a hard limit of 8192 tokens. Documents exceeding this limit must be
 * chunked before embedding generation. This processor ensures all text fits the token budget while
 * maintaining semantic coherence through overlapping chunks.
 *
 * ## Token Limits & Safety Margins
 * - BGE-M3 max tokens: 8192
 * - Default maxTokens: 7372 (90% safety factor to prevent edge-case truncation)
 * - Default overlapTokens: 1474 (20% of maxTokens for context preservation)
 *
 * The safety margin accounts for tokenization variability between tiktoken (cl100k_base) and
 * the model's actual tokenizer. A 10% buffer prevents rejected requests due to slight differences.
 *
 * ## Overlap Strategy
 * Overlapping chunks ensure that semantic relationships spanning chunk boundaries are preserved:
 * - Chunk 1: tokens [0...7372]
 * - Chunk 2: tokens [5898...13270] (last 1474 tokens of chunk 1 reappear)
 * - Chunk 3: tokens [11796...19168]
 *
 * This strategy improves embedding quality for cross-boundary concepts and enables better
 * retrieval in Search-Service when queries match content near chunk edges.
 *
 * ## Integration with TokenCounter
 * This processor delegates all token operations to [TokenCounter]:
 * - [TokenCounter.countTokens] checks if chunking is needed
 * - [TokenCounter.chunkByTokens] performs the actual splitting with overlap
 *
 * TokenCounter uses JTokkit (tiktoken port) with cl100k_base encoding, which approximates
 * the BGE-M3 model's tokenization behavior.
 *
 * ## Data Flow in Pipeline
 * ```
 * Source → RssToText → Chunker → Embedder → TextToVector → QdrantSink
 *                          ↓
 *                  [TextChunk, TextChunk, ...]
 * ```
 *
 * Each chunk is embedded separately, then stored as individual vectors in Qdrant. The chunk metadata
 * (index, totalChunks) enables Search-Service to reconstruct document context when retrieving results.
 *
 * @param maxTokens Maximum tokens per chunk (default 7372 = 90% of BGE-M3's 8192 limit)
 * @param overlapTokens Number of tokens to overlap between consecutive chunks (default 1474 = 20% of maxTokens)
 * @param breakOnSentences Currently unused; reserved for future sentence-boundary detection
 * @param minTokens Minimum tokens to consider a chunk valid (prevents tiny fragments)

    /**
     * Chunks text into overlapping segments that respect BGE-M3's token limit.
     *
     * ## Processing Logic
     * 1. Count total tokens using TokenCounter.countTokens()
     * 2. If text fits within maxTokens, return single chunk (no splitting needed)
     * 3. Otherwise, use TokenCounter.chunkByTokens() to split with overlap
     * 4. Wrap each text segment in TextChunk with index metadata
     *
     * ## Why This Matters
     * Without chunking, the Embedding Service would reject texts exceeding 8192 tokens.
     * By pre-chunking here, we ensure all downstream processors (Embedder, TextToVector)
     * receive token-compliant inputs.

     * @return List of TextChunks, each guaranteed to be ≤ maxTokens
